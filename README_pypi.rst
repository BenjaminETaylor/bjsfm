Bolted Joint Stress Field Model (BJSFM) is a common analytical method used to analyze bolted joints in composite
airframe structures. This project ports the original fortran code to pure python code using the underlying theory. ::

    from bjsfm.lekhnitskii import UnloadedHole
    a_inv = [[0.1, 0.05, 0.], [0.05, 0.1, 0.], [0., 0., 0.5]]  # inverse a-matrix from CLPT
    loads = [100, 100, 50]  # force / unit length
    plate = UnloadedHole(diameter=0.25, thickness=0.1, a_inv=a_inv, loads=loads)

    # get stresses at four points around hole
    plate.stress(x=[0.125, 0., -0.125, 0.], y=[0., 0.125, 0., -0.125])

    # plot stresses
    from bjsfm import plotting
    plotting.plot_stress(plate)
